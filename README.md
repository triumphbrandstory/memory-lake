# Memory Lake

Memory Lake is a digital repository for personal mementos, designed to help you preserve and revisit your cherished memories. Just as a data lake stores and processes various forms of data, Memory Lake serves as a centralized space for your personal memories.

## About Memory Lake

In computer science, a data lake is a centralized repository designed to store, process, and secure large amounts of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data. It can store data in its native format and process any variety of it.

Memory Lake draws inspiration from this concept, recognizing that data lakes and our memories share things in common — both data and mementos can emerge depending on the input or moment we live in the present.

If memories of the past meet us through what we experience in the present, Memory Lake is the possibility of getting in touch with endearing moments more often.
